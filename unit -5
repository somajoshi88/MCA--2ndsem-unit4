MVC, which stands for Model-View-Controller, is a software architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces. It divides an application into three interconnected components, each with specific responsibilities:

Model: The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. It encapsulates the application's data and behavior, responding to requests for information, and notifying observers when the data changes. In simpler terms, it's where the application's data resides and how it is manipulated.

View: The View represents the user interface of the application. It presents the data to the user and interprets user actions such as clicks and keystrokes. The view receives data from the model to display to the user and sends user inputs back to the controller for processing.

Controller: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user inputs from the View, processes them (often by updating the Model), and updates the View accordingly. The controller essentially handles user interactions and updates the model accordingly.

The key idea behind MVC is separation of concerns, where each component has a distinct role and can be developed, tested, and maintained independently. This separation enhances modularity and facilitates changes to one component without affecting the others.

Here's a basic flow of how MVC works:

A user interacts with the View by, for example, clicking a button or entering text into a form.
The View sends the user input to the Controller.
The Controller receives the input, processes it, and may update the Model.
If the Model changes, it notifies the View.
The View retrieves updated data from the Model and refreshes the user interface accordingly.
The cycle continues as users interact with the application.
MVC is widely used in web development frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Django, and Laravel, as well as in desktop and mobile application development. It promotes code reusability, scalability, and maintainability, making it a popular choice for building complex software systems.
